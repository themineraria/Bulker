EULA (End User License Agreement)

By copying, installing, or otherwise using the software, you agree to the following terms and conditions.

If you don't agree to these terms and conditions, uninstall and/or remove the software from your PC(s) and do not download the software (again).

This software is provided as-is, without warranty of ANY KIND, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. The author shall NOT be held liable for ANY damage to you, your computer, or to anyone or anything else, that may result from its use, or misuse, even in the event of a sudden uncontrolled implosion. Basically, you use it at YOUR OWN RISK.

This EULA may change without notice during future updates (but probably not because I actually couldn't care less).
